## ðŸ“˜ TRC3500 Project 2 Breathe Detection Description
This project presents a compact, cost-effective vibration sensing system designed to reliably detect and timestamp breath per minute (BPM) 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The main objective of this project is predict a BPM from the user 

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup & Execution
1. Run and download the STM code to an STM
2. Run the code: main.py
3. Observe the plots and the estimate BPM is printed on the terminal
