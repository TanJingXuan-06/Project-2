## ðŸ“˜ TRC3500 Project 2 Pin Drop Detection Project Description
This project presents a compact, cost-effective vibration sensing system designed to reliably detect and timestamp low-amplitude, sudden-onset vibration events. Instead of generic impacts like a pin drop, this system is tuned and tested to detect the impact of a 50 sen coin and a standard eraser dropped from four different heightâ€“distance combinations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The main objective of this project is to differentiate a coin drop and an eraser drop from : 
1. Length = 10CM, Height = 10CM
2. Length = 10CM, Height = 30CM
3. Length = 30CM, Height = 10CM
4. Length = 30CM, Height = 30CM

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup & Execution
1. Run and download the STM code to an STM
2. Run the code: main.py
3. Depending on the user, select eiter Data Collection mode, Detection mode or Eraser Detection mode (furthest)
4. To detect a softer material than an eraser, use the extraMain.py file.
